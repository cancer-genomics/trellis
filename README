Trellis is a software designed to identify structural variants from whole genome sequenced tumor only BAM files.


This branch is the development branch of trellis.

The main focus of the development branch at this time is to add split reads information to every structural varian type.

Target branches will be created from this branch as <initials-newfeature>
ex. dh-deletion-split-reads
